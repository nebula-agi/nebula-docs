# Chunk Management

The Chunks API allows you to manage text chunks that have been extracted from documents. Chunks are smaller pieces of text that are used for more efficient retrieval and processing.

## Overview

The Chunks API provides:

- **Chunk Management**: Create, update, and delete text chunks
- **Chunk Search**: Search through chunks with various filters
- **Metadata Management**: Manage chunk metadata and properties
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Access chunks for processing and analysis

## Endpoints

- `GET /chunks` - List chunks
- `GET /chunks/{id}` - Get chunk
- `POST /chunks/{id}` - Update chunk
- `DELETE /chunks/{id}` - Delete chunk

### Chunk Search

## Documentation Status

⚠️ **This documentation is currently being written.** 

The Chunks API contains 5 endpoints for chunk management. This documentation will be completed as part of the comprehensive R2R API documentation effort.

**Estimated completion**: Next week
