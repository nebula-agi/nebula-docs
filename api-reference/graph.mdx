# Knowledge Graph

The Graph API enables you to build and manage knowledge graphs in the R2R platform. Knowledge graphs represent information as a network of entities and relationships, enabling powerful semantic search and AI applications.

## Overview

The Graph API provides:

- **Entity Management**: Create, update, and manage entities in the knowledge graph
- **Relationship Management**: Define and manage relationships between entities
- **Community Detection**: Automatically identify and manage entity communities
- **Graph Operations**: Build, reset, and maintain knowledge graphs
- **Export Capabilities**: Export graph data for analysis and visualization

## Endpoints

## Documentation Status

⚠️ **This documentation is currently being written.** 

The Graph API contains 20+ endpoints for knowledge graph management. This documentation will be completed as part of the comprehensive R2R API documentation effort.

**Estimated completion**: Next 3-5 days

For now, please refer to the [R2R API Reference Overview](./r2r-api-reference) for general information about the API structure and authentication.
