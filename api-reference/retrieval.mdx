# Retrieval Operations

The Retrieval API provides the core search and retrieval functionality for the R2R platform. This includes semantic search, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) queries, conversational agents, and embedding generation.

## Overview

The Retrieval API enables:

- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant documents using natural language queries
- **RAG Queries**: Generate responses based on retrieved context
- **Conversational Agents**: Build AI agents that can search and respond
- **Embedding Generation**: Create vector embeddings for text
- **Message Completions**: Generate text completions with context

## Endpoints

### Search & Retrieval

- `POST /retrieval/search` - Search R2R
- `POST /retrieval/rag` - RAG Query

### AI & Generation

- `POST /retrieval/agent` - RAG-powered Conversational Agent
- `POST /retrieval/completion` - Generate Message Completions

### Embeddings

- `POST /retrieval/embedding` - Generate Embeddings

## Documentation Status

⚠️ **This documentation is currently being written.** 

The Retrieval API contains 5 core endpoints for search and AI operations. This documentation will be completed as part of the comprehensive R2R API documentation effort.

**Estimated completion**: Next 1-2 days

For now, please refer to the [R2R API Reference Overview](./r2r-api-reference) for general information about the API structure and authentication.
