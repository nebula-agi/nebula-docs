# Welcome to Nebula

Nebula is the memory layer for AI applications. It ingests documents, conversations, files, and connected sources, then builds a knowledge graph your AI can search and reason over. Retrieval returns entities, facts, and source utterances instead of flat text chunks.

## Quick Example

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from nebula import Nebula

nebula = Nebula(api_key="your_api_key")

# Create a collection
collection = nebula.create_collection(name="engineering_team")

# Store a memory
nebula.store_memory({
    "collection_id": collection.id,
    "content": "Sarah led the migration from PostgreSQL to Aurora last quarter. The project reduced our p99 latency from 200ms to 45ms.",
    "metadata": {"source": "standup_notes"}
})

# Search
results = nebula.search(
    query="What has Sarah worked on?",
    collection_ids=[collection.id]
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const { Nebula } = require('@nebula-ai/sdk');

const nebula = new Nebula({ apiKey: 'your_api_key' });

async function example() {
  // Create a collection
  const collection = await nebula.createCollection({
    name: 'engineering_team'
  });

  // Store a memory
  await nebula.storeMemory({
    collection_id: collection.id,
    content: 'Sarah led the migration from PostgreSQL to Aurora last quarter. The project reduced our p99 latency from 200ms to 45ms.',
    metadata: { source: 'standup_notes' }
  });

  // Search
  const results = await nebula.search({
    query: 'What has Sarah worked on?',
    collection_ids: [collection.id]
  });
}
```

```bash cURL
# Create a collection
curl -X POST "https://api.trynebula.ai/v1/collections" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"name": "engineering_team"}'

# Store a memory
curl -X POST "https://api.trynebula.ai/v1/memories" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "collection_id": "COLLECTION_ID",
    "engram_type": "document",
    "raw_text": "Sarah led the migration from PostgreSQL to Aurora last quarter. The project reduced our p99 latency from 200ms to 45ms.",
    "metadata": {"source": "standup_notes"}
  }'

# Search
curl -X POST "https://api.trynebula.ai/v1/memories/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What has Sarah worked on?",
    "collection_ids": ["COLLECTION_ID"]
  }'
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ingest">
    Store documents, conversations, or files. Connect external sources like Google Drive, Gmail, Notion, and Slack. Nebula parses 40+ file formats including PDFs, images, and audio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract">
    Nebula automatically builds a knowledge graph from your content, linking entities and relationships with temporal awareness and fact corroboration across sources.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Recall">
    Search returns three layers of memory: **entities** (who and what), **facts** (assertions about them), and **utterances** (the original source text).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Features

- **Knowledge Graph** - Automatic entity and relationship extraction from raw content
- **Hierarchical Retrieval** - Three layers: entities, facts, and source utterances
- **Hybrid Search** - Semantic and fulltext search with configurable weights and effort levels
- **Multimodal Ingestion** - 40+ file formats including PDFs, images, audio, and code
- **Connectors** - Sync from Google Drive, Gmail, Notion, and Slack via OAuth
- **Conversation Memory** - Multi-turn context with speaker identity tracking
- **Multi-Language SDKs** - Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, REST API, and MCP
