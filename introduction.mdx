  <Card title="Storage Layer">
    <ul>
      <li>AWS S3 for file storage</li>
      <li>DynamoDB for metadata</li>
      <li>Supabase for authentication</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Layer">
    <ul>
      <li>RESTful API endpoints</li>
      <li>Multiple client libraries</li>
      <li>Granular permissions</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI Layer">
    <ul>
      <li>Document processing</li>
      <li>Entity extraction</li>
      <li>Knowledge graph generation</li>
    </ul>

## Quick Start

Get started with Nebula in just a few steps:

```bash
# Install the Python client
pip install nebula-client

# Or use Node.js
npm install @oronila/nebula-client

# Or use Go
go get github.com/oronila/nebula-client-go
```

```python
from nebula import NebulaClient

# Initialize client
client = NebulaClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# Upload a file
result = client.upload_file(
    cluster_id="your-cluster-id",
    file_path="document.pdf"
)

# Process with AI
entities = client.documents.extract(id=result.file_id)
```

## Client Libraries

Nebula provides official client libraries for multiple programming languages:
