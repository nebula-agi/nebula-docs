Every conversation is automatically captured and stored in Nebula. When you need to recall something from a past session - what you worked on, how something was implemented, a decision you made - Claude can search your memory and bring it back.

## How It Works

### Automatic Capture

The plugin hooks into two Claude Code lifecycle events:

- **UserPromptSubmit** - captures new messages each time you send a prompt
- **Stop** - captures any remaining messages when Claude finishes responding

Messages are sent to Nebula as conversation memories using `storeMemories()`. Nebula handles chunking, embedding, ranking, deduplication, and knowledge graph extraction server-side. The plugin tracks what has already been sent per session so nothing is duplicated.

### Search

Use the `/nebula-search` slash command to search across all stored sessions:

```
/nebula-search "how did we set up authentication?"
```

This performs a semantic search over your collection and returns the most relevant conversation fragments, ranked by activation score.

### Codebase Indexing

Use `/index` to have Claude explore your codebase and store a comprehensive summary (architecture, conventions, key files) into Nebula for future reference.

## Setup

### 1. Get a Nebula API Key

Sign up at [trynebula.ai](https://trynebula.ai) and create an API key from your dashboard.

### 2. Create a Collection

Create a collection in Nebula (via the dashboard or API). Copy the **collection ID** - this is where your memories will be stored.

### 3. Configure Credentials

Create the settings file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.nebula-claude
cat > ~/.nebula-claude/settings.json << 'EOF'
{
  "apiKey": "your-nebula-api-key",
  "collectionId": "your-collection-id"
}
EOF
```

Alternatively, use environment variables (these override the settings file):

```bash
export CC_NEBULA_API_KEY="your-nebula-api-key"
export CC_NEBULA_COLLECTION_ID="your-collection-id"
```

### 4. Install the Plugin

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nebula-agi/claude-nebula.git
cd claude-nebula
npm install
npm run build
claude plugin install ./plugin
```

The build step bundles the source files into `plugin/scripts/*.cjs` using esbuild.

### 5. Verify

Start a new Claude Code session. The capture hooks will run automatically in the background. Try a search to confirm everything is connected:

```
/nebula-search "test"
```

## Configuration Reference

| Setting | settings.json key | Environment variable | Required |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|
| API Key | `apiKey` | `CC_NEBULA_API_KEY` | Yes |
| Collection ID | `collectionId` | `CC_NEBULA_COLLECTION_ID` | Yes |
| Debug logging | `debug` | `CC_NEBULA_DEBUG=true` | No |

Settings file location: `~/.nebula-claude/settings.json`

Environment variables take precedence over the settings file.

## Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/nebula-search "query"` | Search your memory for relevant past conversations |
| `/index` | Index your current codebase into Nebula |
| `/logout` | Clear saved Nebula credentials |
